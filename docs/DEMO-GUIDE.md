# Waza Demo Guide

**Comprehensive walk-through for demonstrating waza's capabilities.**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for 9 practical demonstrations covering all major waza features. Each demo is self-contained and can be run independently.

---

## Quick Setup

Before any demo, ensure waza is installed:

```bash
# Option A: Binary install (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spboyer/waza/main/install.sh | bash

# Option B: Build from source
cd /path/to/waza
make build

# Verify installation
waza run --help
```

---

## Demo 1: Quick Start Demo (2 min)

**What it shows:** How fast you can install waza and run your first evaluation.

### Setup

- **Location:** `examples/code-explainer/`
- **Prerequisite:** waza binary built
- **Model:** Uses mock executor (no API keys needed for demo)

### Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/waza

# Show the example structure
echo "📁 Example directory structure:"
tree examples/code-explainer/ -L 2

# Run the evaluation with verbose output
./waza-bin run examples/code-explainer/eval.yaml \
  --context-dir examples/code-explainer/fixtures \
  -v

# Save results to JSON for later analysis
./waza-bin run examples/code-explainer/eval.yaml \
  --context-dir examples/code-explainer/fixtures \
  -o results.json

# Show the results
echo "📊 Results saved to results.json"
cat results.json | jq '.summary'
```

### Expected Output

- Real-time task execution with progress indicators
- Summary showing:
  - Number of tasks run
  - Overall score (0.0-1.0)
  - Metrics breakdown (task_completion, trigger_accuracy, behavior_quality)
  - Pass/fail per task
- JSON results file with full execution details

### Talking Points

1. **Single Binary:** "Everything you need is in one command. No Python venv, no package management."
2. **Fast Iteration:** "Run evals in seconds with mock executor, then switch to real models."
3. **Reproducible:** "Same eval.yaml runs the same way everywhere—CI, local, your teammate's machine."
4. **Structured Output:** "JSON results let you integrate with dashboards, reports, or CI/CD."

## Demo 2: Grader Showcase Demo (5 min)

**What it shows:** The five grader types in action—how to validate different aspects of agent behavior.

### Setup

- **Location:** `examples/grader-showcase/`
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Each task shows one grader type
  - `code-task.yaml` → Code grader (Python assertions)
  - `regex-task.yaml` → Regex grader (pattern matching)
  - `file-task.yaml` → File grader (file operations)
  - `behavior-task.yaml` → Behavior grader (efficiency constraints)
  - `action-sequence-task.yaml` → Action sequence grader (tool calls)

### Commands

```bash
# Show the grader-showcase eval structure
echo "📋 Grader types showcase:"
ls -lh examples/grader-showcase/tasks/

# Run the showcase with verbose output to see each grader in action
./waza-bin run examples/grader-showcase/eval.yaml \
  --context-dir examples/grader-showcase/fixtures \
  -v

# Run just the regex task to focus on one grader type
./waza-bin run examples/grader-showcase/eval.yaml \
  --context-dir examples/grader-showcase/fixtures \
  --task "regex-*" \
  -v

# Show the eval.yaml to highlight grader configuration
echo "🔍 Global graders in eval.yaml:"
grep -A 8 "^graders:" examples/grader-showcase/eval.yaml

# Show one task file to explain task-specific graders
echo "📄 Example task with graders:"
head -40 examples/grader-showcase/tasks/code-task.yaml
```

### Expected Output

- Each task runs with clear pass/fail status
- Grader output explains why validation passed/failed
- Summary showing:
  - Grader pass rates
  - Individual grader scores
  - Overall task score

### Talking Points

1. **Flexible Validation:** "Code graders for logic, regex for patterns, files for outputs, behavior for efficiency."
2. **Composable:** "Mix and match graders on each task. Use global graders for all tasks, task-specific for edge cases."
3. **Clear Feedback:** "Each grader tells you exactly what passed/failed and why."
4. **Production-Ready:** "These graders let you enforce quality standards in CI/CD pipelines."

### Deep Dive: Show Individual Grader Configs

```bash
# Show each task's grader config
echo "=== Code Grader Example ==="
grep -A 10 "^graders:" examples/grader-showcase/tasks/code-task.yaml

echo ""
echo "=== Regex Grader Example ==="
grep -A 10 "^graders:" examples/grader-showcase/tasks/regex-task.yaml

echo ""
echo "=== File Grader Example ==="
grep -A 10 "^graders:" examples/grader-showcase/tasks/file-task.yaml
