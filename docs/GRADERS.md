# Grader Reference

Complete reference for all available grader types in waza.

## Overview

Graders evaluate skill execution and produce scores. Each grader returns:
- `score`: 0.0 to 1.0
- `passed`: boolean
- `message`: human-readable result
- `details`: additional metadata

## Inline vs Script Graders

Graders can be defined in two ways:

### Inline Graders (in eval.yaml or task files)

Best for simple validation logic that fits in YAML:

```yaml
graders:
  - type: code
    name: basic_check
    config:
      assertions:
        - "len(output) > 10"
        - "'success' in output.lower()"
  
  - type: regex
    name: format_check
    config:
      must_match:
        - "deployed to .+"
```

### Script Graders (in graders/ directory)

Best for complex, multi-criteria evaluation logic:

```
my-waza/
├── eval.yaml
├── tasks/
└── graders/
    └── quality_checker.py    # Complex custom logic
```

Reference in eval.yaml:
```yaml
graders:
  - type: script
    name: quality_checker
    config:
      script: graders/quality_checker.py
```

**When to use script graders:**
- Multi-criteria scoring (5+ checks)
- Domain-specific business logic
- Reusable across multiple evals
- Complex pattern matching or analysis
- Integration with external services

See the [code-explainer example](../examples/code-explainer/graders/explanation_quality.py) for a complete script grader implementation.

## Code Graders

### `code` - Assertion-Based Grader

Evaluates Python expressions against the execution context.

```yaml
- type: code
  name: my_grader
  config:
    assertions:
      - "len(output) > 0"
      - "'success' in output.lower()"
      - "len(errors) == 0"
```

**Available Context Variables:**
| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `output` | str | Final skill output |
| `outcome` | dict | Outcome state |
| `transcript` | list | Full execution transcript |
| `tool_calls` | list | Tool calls from transcript |
| `errors` | list | Errors from transcript |
| `duration_ms` | int | Execution duration |

**Available Functions:**
`len`, `any`, `all`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, `re` (regex module)

**Scoring:** `passed_assertions / total_assertions`

**⚠️ Important:** Do NOT use generator expressions in assertions. They don't work with Python's `eval()` in restricted scope.

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - generator expressions fail
assertions:
  - "any(kw in output for kw in ['azure', 'deploy'])"

# ✅ CORRECT - use explicit or chains
assertions:
  - "'azure' in output.lower() or 'deploy' in output.lower()"
```

---

### `regex` - Pattern Matching Grader

Matches output against regex patterns.

```yaml
- type: regex
  name: format_checker
  config:
    must_match:
      - "deployed to https?://.+"
      - "Resource group: .+"
    must_not_match:
      - "error|failed|exception"
      - "permission denied"
```

**Options:**
| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `must_match` | list[str] | Patterns that MUST appear |
| `must_not_match` | list[str] | Patterns that MUST NOT appear |

**Scoring:** `passed_checks / total_checks`

---

### `tool_calls` - Tool Usage Grader

Validates which tools were called and how.

```yaml
- type: tool_calls
  name: tool_validator
  config:
    required:
      - pattern: "azd up"
      - pattern: "git commit"
    forbidden:
      - pattern: "rm -rf"
      - pattern: "sudo"
    max_calls: 20
```

**Options:**
| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `required` | list | Patterns that MUST appear in tool calls |
| `forbidden` | list | Patterns that MUST NOT appear |
| `max_calls` | int | Maximum allowed tool calls |

---

### `script` - External Script Grader

Runs a custom Python script for complex validation.

```yaml
- type: script
  name: custom_logic
  config:
    script: graders/my_grader.py
```

**Script Format:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys

def grade(context: dict) -> dict:
    output = context.get("output", "")
    
    # Your custom logic here
    score = 1.0 if "success" in output else 0.0
    
    return {
        "score": score,
        "passed": score >= 0.5,
        "message": "Custom grading complete",
        "details": {"custom_field": "value"}
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    context = json.load(sys.stdin)
    print(json.dumps(grade(context)))
```

---

## LLM Graders

### `llm` - LLM-as-Judge Grader

Uses an AI model to evaluate quality.

```yaml
- type: llm
  name: quality_judge
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  rubric: |
    Score the skill execution from 1-5:
    
    1. Correctness: Did it accomplish the task?
    2. Completeness: Were all requirements addressed?
    3. Quality: Was the approach appropriate?
    
    Return JSON: {"score": N, "reasoning": "...", "passed": true/false}
```

**Options:**
| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `model` | str | Model to use (default: gpt-4o-mini) |
| `rubric` | str | Evaluation rubric (inline or file path) |
| `threshold` | float | Pass threshold (default: 0.75) |

**Score Normalization:** Raw scores 1-5 are normalized to 0-1:
- Score 1 → 0.0
- Score 3 → 0.5
- Score 5 → 1.0

---

### `llm_comparison` - Reference Comparison Grader

Compares output against a reference using LLM.

```yaml
- type: llm_comparison
  name: reference_check
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  config:
    reference: |
      Expected output should include:
      - Confirmation of deployment
      - URL of deployed resource
      - Next steps for the user
```

---

## Human Graders

### `human` - Manual Review Grader

Marks tasks for human review.

```yaml
- type: human
  name: expert_review
  config:
    instructions: "Review for security best practices"
    criteria:
      - "Uses managed identity"
      - "No hardcoded secrets"
      - "Follows least privilege"
```

**Output:** Returns `pending` status until human submits review.

---

### `human_calibration` - Calibration Grader

Collects human labels to calibrate LLM graders.

```yaml
- type: human_calibration
  name: calibrate_quality
  config:
    calibrate_grader: quality_judge
```

---

## Behavior Graders

### `behavior` - Agent Behavior Validation

Validates agent behavior patterns like tool call counts, token usage, and execution duration.

```yaml
- type: behavior
  name: efficiency_check
  config:
    max_tool_calls: 20
    max_tokens: 10000
    max_duration_ms: 300000
    required_tools:
      - "bash"
      - "view"
    forbidden_tools:
      - "rm -rf"
      - "sudo"
```

**Options:**
| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `max_tool_calls` | int | Maximum allowed tool calls |
| `max_tokens` | int | Maximum token usage allowed |
| `max_duration_ms` | int64 | Maximum execution time in milliseconds |
| `required_tools` | list[str] | Tool names (exact matches) that MUST be called |
| `forbidden_tools` | list[str] | Tool names (exact matches) that MUST NOT be called |

**Note:** `required_tools` and `forbidden_tools` use exact string matching on tool names; patterns, wildcards, or regular expressions are not supported.

**Scoring:** Composite score based on all behavior constraints passed/failed.

---

### `action_sequence` - Tool Call Sequence Validation

Validates that the agent's tool calls match an expected action sequence. Supports three matching modes and calculates precision, recall, and F1 scores.

```yaml
- type: action_sequence
  name: deployment_workflow
  config:
    matching_mode: in_order_match
    expected_actions:
      - "bash"
      - "edit"
      - "bash"
      - "report_progress"
```

**Options:**
| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `matching_mode` | string | How to match sequences (see modes below) |
| `expected_actions` | list[str] | List of expected tool names in sequence |

**Matching Modes:**

1. **`exact_match`** - Perfect match required
   - Actual sequence must match expected sequence exactly
   - Same length, same order, same tools
   - Example: Expected `["bash", "edit"]` only matches actual `["bash", "edit"]`

2. **`in_order_match`** - Actions must appear in order
   - All expected actions must appear in actual sequence
   - Can have extra actions between expected ones
   - Order must be preserved
   - Example: Expected `["bash", "edit"]` matches actual `["bash", "view", "edit", "report_progress"]`

3. **`any_order_match`** - All actions present regardless of order
   - All expected actions must appear in actual sequence
   - Order doesn't matter
   - Frequency must match (if expected has 2x "bash", actual must have at least 2x "bash")
   - Example: Expected `["edit", "bash"]` matches actual `["bash", "view", "edit"]`

**Scoring:**

The grader calculates three metrics:
- **Precision**: `true_positives / len(actual_actions)` - What fraction of actual actions were expected?
- **Recall**: `true_positives / len(expected_actions)` - What fraction of expected actions were performed?
- **F1 Score**: `2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)` - Harmonic mean (used as the final score)

The `passed` field is based on the matching mode constraint, while the `score` field always uses F1.

**Example Use Cases:**

```yaml
# Ensure exact workflow for reproducible demos
- type: action_sequence
  name: demo_script
  config:
    matching_mode: exact_match
    expected_actions: ["bash", "view", "edit", "bash", "report_progress"]

# Verify key steps happen in order (allows flexibility)
- type: action_sequence
  name: deployment_flow
  config:
    matching_mode: in_order_match
    expected_actions: ["bash", "edit", "report_progress"]

# Check that required tools were used (any order)
- type: action_sequence
  name: required_tools
  config:
    matching_mode: any_order_match
    expected_actions: ["bash", "view", "edit"]
```

---

### `skill_invocation` - Skill Invocation Sequence Validation

Validates that dependent skills were invoked in the correct sequence during orchestration skill execution. Useful for verifying that orchestration workflows call the right skills in the right order.

```yaml
- type: skill_invocation
  name: verify_orchestration
  config:
    required_skills:
      - azure-prepare
      - azure-deploy
    mode: in_order
    allow_extra: true
```

**Options:**
| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | How to match sequences (see modes below) |
| `required_skills` | list[str] | List of required skill names in sequence |
| `allow_extra` | bool | Whether to allow extra skill invocations (default: true) |

**Matching Modes:**

1. **`exact_match`** - Perfect match required
   - Actual sequence must match required sequence exactly
   - Same length, same order, same skills
   - Example: Required `["azure-prepare", "azure-deploy"]` only matches actual `["azure-prepare", "azure-deploy"]`

2. **`in_order`** - Skills must appear in order
   - All required skills must appear in actual sequence
   - Can have extra skills between required ones (if `allow_extra: true`)
   - Order must be preserved
   - Example: Required `["azure-prepare", "azure-deploy"]` matches actual `["azure-prepare", "azure-validate", "azure-deploy"]`

3. **`any_order`** - All skills present regardless of order
   - All required skills must appear in actual sequence
   - Order doesn't matter
   - Frequency must match (if required has 2x "skill-a", actual must have at least 2x "skill-a")
   - Example: Required `["azure-deploy", "azure-prepare"]` matches actual `["azure-prepare", "azure-validate", "azure-deploy"]`

**Scoring:**

The grader calculates three metrics:
- **Precision**: `true_positives / len(actual_skills)` - What fraction of actual invocations were required?
- **Recall**: `true_positives / len(required_skills)` - What fraction of required skills were invoked?
- **F1 Score**: `2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)` - Harmonic mean (base score)

When `allow_extra: false`, the score is penalized for extra skill invocations beyond the required set.

The `passed` field is based on the matching mode constraint, while the `score` field uses F1 (with optional penalty).

**Example Use Cases:**

```yaml
# Ensure exact orchestration workflow for reproducible deployments
- type: skill_invocation
  name: deployment_sequence
  config:
    mode: exact_match
    required_skills: ["azure-prepare", "azure-deploy", "azure-monitor"]
    allow_extra: false

# Verify key skills happen in order (allows flexibility)
- type: skill_invocation
  name: orchestration_flow
  config:
    mode: in_order
    required_skills: ["azure-prepare", "azure-deploy"]
    allow_extra: true

# Check that required skills were invoked (any order)
- type: skill_invocation
  name: required_skills
  config:
    mode: any_order
    required_skills: ["azure-prepare", "azure-deploy", "azure-validate"]
    allow_extra: true
```

**Data Source:**

This grader uses `SkillInvocations` data collected during execution via the Copilot SDK's `SkillInvoked` events. The skill names are extracted from the `Name` field of each `SkillInvocation` struct.

---

## LLM-as-Judge Graders

### `prompt` - LLM-Based Evaluation

Uses a language model to evaluate skill execution quality based on a rubric. This grader follows the Azure ML evaluator pattern for LLM-as-judge evaluation.

> **Note:** This grader requires implementation and is currently planned for a future release.

```yaml
- type: prompt
  name: quality_judge
  config:
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    rubric: |
      Evaluate the code explanation on these criteria:
      
      1. **Correctness** (1-5): Is the explanation technically accurate?
      2. **Completeness** (1-5): Are all key concepts covered?
      3. **Clarity** (1-5): Is it easy to understand?
      
      Provide:
      - A score for each criterion (1-5)
      - Overall assessment (1-5)
      - Brief reasoning
      
      Return JSON:
      {
        "correctness": <1-5>,
        "completeness": <1-5>,
        "clarity": <1-5>,
        "overall_score": <1-5>,
        "reasoning": "...",
        "passed": <true/false>
      }
    threshold: 0.75
    score_type: normalized
    response_format: json
```

**Options:**
| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `model` | string | Model to use for evaluation (default: gpt-4o-mini) |
| `rubric` | string | Evaluation rubric (inline text or file path) |
| `threshold` | float | Pass threshold (default: 0.75) |
| `score_type` | string | How to interpret scores: `normalized` (1-5 → 0-1) or `raw` |
| `response_format` | string | Expected response format: `json` or `text` |

**How Rubrics Work:**

A rubric is a structured evaluation criteria that guides the LLM's assessment:

1. **Define Criteria**: List specific aspects to evaluate (correctness, completeness, clarity, etc.)
2. **Rating Scale**: Specify the scale (typically 1-5 or 1-10)
3. **Guidelines**: Describe what each rating level means
4. **Output Format**: Request structured output (JSON preferred) with scores and reasoning

**Example: Multi-Criteria Rubric**

```yaml
- type: prompt
  name: comprehensive_quality
  config:
    model: gpt-4o
    rubric: |
      Evaluate the agent's performance:
      
      **Criteria:**
      1. Task Completion (1-5): Did the agent accomplish the stated goal?
         - 1: Failed completely
         - 3: Partially completed
         - 5: Fully completed with excellence
      
      2. Approach Quality (1-5): Was the approach appropriate and efficient?
         - 1: Poor approach with significant issues
         - 3: Adequate but could be improved
         - 5: Excellent, optimal approach
      
      3. Code Quality (1-5): Is the code well-structured and maintainable?
         - 1: Poor structure, hard to maintain
         - 3: Acceptable quality
         - 5: Excellent quality, follows best practices
      
      **Output Format (JSON):**
      {
        "task_completion": <score>,
        "approach_quality": <score>,
        "code_quality": <score>,
        "overall_score": <average of above>,
        "reasoning": "<2-3 sentence explanation>",
        "passed": <true if overall_score >= 3.5>
      }
      
      Think step-by-step and provide honest, critical evaluation.
    threshold: 0.7
    score_type: normalized
```

**Writing Custom Rubrics:**

Follow these best practices:

1. **Be Specific**: Define exactly what you're evaluating
2. **Use Clear Scales**: Explain what each rating means
3. **Request Reasoning**: Ask for chain-of-thought explanation
4. **Structured Output**: Use JSON for reliable parsing
5. **Include Pass Threshold**: Make the LLM decide pass/fail based on criteria
6. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Be explicit about edge cases

**Common Rubric Patterns:**

```yaml
# Binary pass/fail evaluation
rubric: |
  Does the output meet these requirements?
  1. Contains user authentication
  2. Follows security best practices
  3. Includes error handling
  
  Return JSON: {"score": 1 or 0, "passed": true/false, "reasoning": "..."}

# Comparative evaluation
rubric: |
  Compare the agent's solution to this reference approach:
  [reference description]
  
  Rate similarity (1-5) and quality improvement (1-5).
  Return JSON with scores and reasoning.

# Style compliance check
rubric: |
  Evaluate code style compliance:
  - Naming conventions
  - Documentation completeness
  - Code organization
  
  Return JSON with per-criterion scores and overall assessment.
```

**Shipped Rubric Templates:**

> **Note:** Rubric templates will be provided in a future release. These will include pre-built rubrics for:
> - Code quality assessment
> - Security best practices
> - Documentation completeness
> - API design quality
> - Test coverage evaluation

## Azure ML Evaluator Integration

Waza's grader system is designed to be compatible with [Azure AI Evaluation SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk) patterns. The `prompt` grader specifically implements the LLM-as-judge pattern used by Azure ML evaluators.

### Supported Azure ML Evaluator Patterns

The following Azure ML evaluator types map to Waza graders:

| Azure ML Evaluator | Waza Grader | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `RelevanceEvaluator` | `prompt` | Uses LLM to judge response relevance |
| `CoherenceEvaluator` | `prompt` | Evaluates logical flow and coherence |
| `FluencyEvaluator` | `prompt` | Assesses natural language quality |
| `GroundednessEvaluator` | `prompt` | Checks factual grounding |
| `ContentSafetyEvaluator` | `prompt` | Validates content safety |
| Custom evaluators | `prompt` | Any custom LLM-based evaluator |

### Adapting Azure ML Evaluators as Waza Rubrics

You can adapt Azure ML evaluators to Waza by converting their evaluation criteria into rubrics:

**Example: Azure ML Relevance Evaluator → Waza Rubric**

```yaml
# Azure ML pattern
evaluator = RelevanceEvaluator(model_config)
result = evaluator(query=query, response=response)

# Equivalent Waza configuration
- type: prompt
  name: relevance_check
  config:
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    rubric: |
      Evaluate how relevant the agent's response is to the user's query.
      
      Query: [Available in the test case prompt; the agent's response is provided as 'output']
      
      Rate relevance (1-5):
      1 - Completely irrelevant
      2 - Slightly relevant
      3 - Moderately relevant
      4 - Very relevant
      5 - Perfectly relevant and comprehensive
      
      Return JSON: {
        "relevance_score": <1-5>,
        "reasoning": "<explanation>",
        "passed": <true if score >= 4>
      }
    threshold: 0.75
```

**Example: Custom Azure ML Evaluator → Waza Rubric**

```python
# Azure ML custom evaluator
from promptflow.core import Prompty

evaluator = Prompty.load("security_evaluator.prompty")

# Convert to Waza rubric
```

```yaml
- type: prompt
  name: security_check
  config:
    model: gpt-4o
    rubric: |
      Evaluate the code for security vulnerabilities:
      
      Criteria:
      1. Input Validation: Are inputs properly validated?
      2. Authentication: Is auth implemented correctly?
      3. Data Protection: Is sensitive data protected?
      4. Error Handling: Are errors handled securely?
      
      For each criterion, rate 1-5 and provide specific findings.
      
      Return JSON: {
        "input_validation": <score>,
        "authentication": <score>,
        "data_protection": <score>,
        "error_handling": <score>,
        "overall_score": <average>,
        "findings": ["<issue 1>", "<issue 2>", ...],
        "passed": <true if overall >= 4>
      }
    threshold: 0.8
```

### Using Azure ML Prompt Flow Templates

Azure ML Prompt Flow `.prompty` files can be adapted to Waza rubrics:

1. **Extract the system prompt** from the `.prompty` file
2. **Convert to YAML rubric** in your grader config
3. **Map inputs** (context variables are available: `output`, `transcript`, `tool_calls`, etc.)
4. **Preserve scoring logic** from the original evaluator

**Example Conversion:**

```prompty
---
name: CodeQualityEvaluator
description: Evaluates code quality
inputs:
  code: string
outputs:
  score: integer
  reasoning: string
---
system:
Evaluate the code quality on a scale of 1-5...
[evaluation criteria]
```

Becomes:

```yaml
- type: prompt
  name: code_quality
  config:
    rubric: |
      Evaluate the code quality on a scale of 1-5...
      [evaluation criteria - copied from .prompty]
      
      Return JSON: {"score": <1-5>, "reasoning": "..."}
```

### Creating Custom LLM-as-Judge Graders

To create graders that match Azure ML evaluator patterns:

1. **Define clear criteria**: What aspects are you evaluating?
2. **Use consistent scales**: 1-5 or 1-10 (Waza normalizes to 0-1)
3. **Request chain-of-thought**: Ask the LLM to explain its reasoning
4. **Structure output**: Use JSON for reliable parsing
5. **Set appropriate thresholds**: Define what "passing" means for your criteria

**Template:**

```yaml
- type: prompt
  name: my_custom_evaluator
  config:
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    rubric: |
      Evaluate [what you're assessing] based on:
      
      1. [Criterion 1] (1-5): [Description]
      2. [Criterion 2] (1-5): [Description]
      3. [Criterion 3] (1-5): [Description]
      
      For each criterion:
      - Consider [specific aspects]
      - Rate honestly and critically
      - Provide specific examples
      
      Return JSON: {
        "criterion1_score": <1-5>,
        "criterion2_score": <1-5>,
        "criterion3_score": <1-5>,
        "overall_score": <average>,
        "reasoning": "<detailed explanation>",
        "passed": <true/false based on threshold>
      }
      
      Context available:
      - output: The agent's final response
      - tool_calls: List of tools the agent used
      - duration_ms: Execution time
    threshold: 0.7
    score_type: normalized
```

---

## Task-Level Graders

You can also define graders per-task:

```yaml
# In task YAML
graders:
  - name: task_specific_check
    type: code
    assertions:
      - "specific_condition"
    weight: 0.5  # Weight within this task
```

---

## Grader Weights

When multiple graders are used, results are combined:

```yaml
graders:
  - type: code
    name: basic_check
    # Default weight: 1.0
  
  - type: llm
    name: quality_check
    # Default weight: 1.0
```

**Final Score:** Average of all grader scores (weighted if specified)

---

## Creating Custom Graders

Extend the `Grader` base class:

```python
from waza.graders.base import Grader, GraderContext, GraderType, GraderRegistry
from waza.schemas.results import GraderResult

@GraderRegistry.register("my_custom")
class MyCustomGrader(Grader):
    @property
    def grader_type(self) -> GraderType:
        return GraderType.CODE
    
    def grade(self, context: GraderContext) -> GraderResult:
        # Your logic here
        return GraderResult(
            name=self.name,
            type=self.grader_type.value,
            score=1.0,
            passed=True,
            message="Custom grading complete",
        )
```

Then use in eval.yaml:
```yaml
graders:
  - type: my_custom
    name: special_check
```
