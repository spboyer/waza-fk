## Executive Summary

Waza (技 - Japanese for "skill/technique") is a unified CLI platform for creating, testing, and evaluating AI agent skills. It consolidates existing skill development tools into a single binary that provides the complete developer experience for contributing to [microsoft/skills](https://github.com/microsoft/skills).

### The Problem

The microsoft/skills repository hosts 132+ skills for AI coding agents, but the contribution process lacks automated tooling for:

- **Compliance validation** — No standardized scoring before PR submission
- **Trigger testing** — Manual verification of skill activation patterns
- **Cross-model evaluation** — No framework for testing skills across GPT-4o, Claude, etc.
- **Token budget enforcement** — Guidelines exist but aren't automatically checked

### The Solution

A single `waza` CLI built in **Go** that automates the skill development workflow:

| Phase | Capability |
|-------|------------|
| **Scaffold** | Generate compliant skill structure matching microsoft/skills conventions |
| **Develop** | Iterate with real-time compliance scoring (Sensei engine) |
| **Test** | Run agentic test loops with real LLM execution via Copilot SDK |
| **Evaluate** | Cross-model comparison with task completion, trigger accuracy, behavior quality metrics |

## User Personas

### Primary: Skill Author
- **Role:** Developer contributing skills to microsoft/skills
- **Goals:** Create high-quality skills that pass CI, work across models
- **Pain Points:** Manual testing, unclear compliance requirements, no cross-model validation

### Secondary: Skill Reviewer
- **Role:** Maintainer reviewing skill PRs
- **Goals:** Quickly assess skill quality, ensure compliance
- **Pain Points:** Inconsistent quality, manual verification

### Tertiary: Platform Engineer
- **Role:** CI/CD pipeline maintainer
- **Goals:** Automate skill validation in pipelines
- **Pain Points:** Lack of CLI tools for automation

## Compliance Scoring System

Skills are scored on frontmatter compliance. Target: **Medium-High** or better for publishing.

| Score | Requirements | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Low** | Description < 150 chars OR no triggers | Basic, agent can't route reliably |
| **Medium** | Description >= 150 chars AND has trigger keywords | Functional but may have false positives |
| **Medium-High** | Has "USE FOR:" AND "DO NOT USE FOR:" | Clear boundaries, reliable routing |
| **High** | Medium-High + INVOKES + FOR SINGLE OPERATIONS | Full routing clarity, MCP integration |

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Skill Compliance Rate | >80% Medium-High | Automated scoring via `waza dev` |
| Trigger Accuracy | >90% | Evaluation framework pass rate |
| Time to First Skill | <30 minutes | Developer surveys |
| Cross-Model Consistency | >85% pass rate across 3+ models | Comparison reports |
| Token Efficiency | <500 lines for SKILL.md | `waza tokens check` |

---

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Risk Level |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Copilot SDK | Available | Medium - API stability |
| Go Runtime | Stable | Low |
| AZD Extension Framework | Available (alpha) | Medium - API changes |
| microsoft/skills repo | Exists (132+ skills) | Low - Established |
